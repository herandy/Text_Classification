This project contains popular models for Text Classification implemented in various Deep Learning packages.

Requirements:

    Python 3
    Pytorch
    Keras
    Tensorflow
    tensorflow-gpu
    Theano
    Lasagne
    NLTK
    Gensim

You will preferably need to download and provide some pretrained word vectors, we recommend Glove Common Crawl.
But you can also train them from scratch if you want to.
As to which would be better depends on the size and the distribution of your data.

You can download CSV formatted standard text classification datasets from this [link](http://goo.gl/JyCnZq).
